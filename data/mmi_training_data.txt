why haven't you left?
why are you still standing here?
aren't you going to give me a ride?
i'm too tired today.
i almost got shot, while being involved with you.
i'm sorry, mr. ceo.
i think it's dangerous for me to get dragged into the world you see.
i shouldn't go any further.
there needs to be a firm line between you and me.
are you saying you'll draw a line and tell me to get lost?
let's just keep focused on each other's uses.
from now on, from here to there is tae gong shil's zone.
if you need a safety hideout, instead of talking to me, just touch me here, and leave.
talk to me only when you see something that is useful to me, like cha hee joo.
to me, talking to you about random things made me feel better.
i don't like it, so stick to the rules.
i'll give you the tae gong shil zone.
however, don't try to touch other places.
there are no eyes, ears, or mouth on this arm.
so don't expect me to see, hear, or talk.
mr. ceo, i talked to you because you're not scared of ghosts.
that's right.
i'm not scared of ghosts.
i'm afraid of you, tae gong shil.
is taeyang not coming with us?
she says she has a date.
let's go.
yes.
well, he did almost get shot because of me.
it's understandable that he thinks i'm dangerous.
tae gong shil!
oh it's you, yi ryeong.
hi.
did you come to see a musical?
